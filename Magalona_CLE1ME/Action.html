            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>Education is one of the best solutions to poverty. Globally speaking, even the most basic education – reading, writing and arithmetic – can open doors for children that would otherwise be locked tight. But it’s more than that.
Many experts say that the cycle of poverty simply can’t be broken unless children receive education.
</p>
            <p style="font-style: italic">“Here’s a sense of what can happen in the life of a family in an impoverished region, without education:
In Armenia, a 12-year-old girl left school to help provide for her family, collecting scrap metal on the streets.
Without education, she may have few other employment options, and is likely to continue with menial pay into adulthood.
As uneducated adult, she will likely struggle to provide the necessities of life for her own children – including schooling.
She is unable to understand information critical to her children’s well-being – a leaflet about child nutrition or COVID precautions, for example.
She may be injured or killed on the job, or have to migrate in search of work, leaving children with adult responsibilities and unable to attend school.
Without education, the cycle of poverty continues.</p>
            <p>Imagine what might have been different, had this girl been able to stay in school. A better job for higher pay – or even university. She could have given back in her community and provided more effectively for her own children.</p>
