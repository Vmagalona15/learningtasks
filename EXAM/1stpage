        <img src ="IMAGE" alt="phimg"
        <p> Poverty is defined by a lack of resources in addition to a lack of income. It takes into account economic, social, and governance factors. The poor are deprived not merely of cash and resources, but also of opportunities. Because of limited capacities and geographical and social barriers, markets and occupations are frequently difficult to reach.</p>
