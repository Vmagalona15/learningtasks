            <h1>10 ways to fight corruption</h1>
            <p><b>1. Corruption isn't only about bribes:</b> When resources are wasted, people, particularly the impoverished, suffer. That is why it is critical to comprehend the various types of corruption in order to design effective remedies.</p>
            <p><b>2. Power of the people:</b> Create pathways that give citizens relevant tools to engage and participate in their governments â€“ identify priorities,  problems and find solutions.</p>
            <p><b>3. Reduce red tape: </b>Combine formal and informal methods (this includes working with both government and non-governmental organizations) to alter behavior and track success.</p>
            <p><b>4. It's not 1999: </b>Use technology to create dynamic and ongoing conversations with key stakeholders, such as the government, citizens, businesses, civil society organizations, the media, and academics.</p>
            <p><b>5. Deliver the goods:</b> Invest in institutions and policy long-term improvement in how a government provides services is only possible if the people who work in these institutions support sensible rules and practices that allow for change while maximizing the use of tried and true traditions and legacies imported models frequently fail.</p>
            <p><b>6. Get incentives right:</b> Align anti-corruption efforts with market, behavioral, and societal forces to create the best possible incentives. Adopting integrity standards is a wise business move, particularly for organizations looking to do business with the World Bank Group and other development partners.</p>
            <p><b>7. Sanctions are important:</b> Punishing corruption is an important part of any effective anti-corruption strategy.</p>
            <p><b>8. Act internationally and locally:</b> Keep citizens involved in the fight against corruption at the local, national, international, and global levels, depending on the extent and breadth of the problem. Make use of the interaction architecture that has been created and the platforms that are available.</p>
            <p><b>9. Build capacity for those who need it the most:</b> Countries with a history of chronic fragility, war, and violence have the fewest internal resources to combat corruption. Determine how international resources might be used to support and sustain good governance.</p>
            <p><b>10. Learn by doing:</b> Any excellent strategy should be examined and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure that it can be easily altered as circumstances on the ground change.</p>
