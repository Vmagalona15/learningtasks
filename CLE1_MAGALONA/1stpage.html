            <h4>Problem</h4>
            <h5>Corruption in the Philippines</h5>
            <img src ="P1.jpg" alt="phimg">
            <p>The Philippines has high levels of population growth during crisis periods; high and persistent levels of inequality (incomes and assets), which reduce the positive effects of economic expansion; and economic crisis, conflicts, natural catastrophes, and "environmental poverty" are all examples of recurring shocks and exposure to hazards.</p>
            <p>According to statistics, 16.6% of the population of the Philippines, or roughly 17.6 million people, live in poverty. People who live in rural areas are significantly more likely to be poor, with roughly one-third of those living in poverty working as farmers.</p>
